## Skills to develop
I am looking to improve my skills and grow in my journey to break into tech. I want to work my way into Data Analytics, to Data Science, and eventually Data Engineering. This will take time but I am prepared to commit to this learning experience and journey, not just for me, but for my wife and our future family. Below are the programs/skills that I want to learn.
1. R program
2. SQL
3. Python
